# I am currently using Finnhub which provides up to 60 reqs per min
# This has no minutely, hourly, daily or monthly limit.
# you could also use webhook which might be somthing useful to look into

# ALPHA VANTAGE - NOTE: DO NOT USE BETTER OPTIONS AVAILABLE
# it should be noted this key is free (OQTQ7NGARONXP2MD) and you can get your own at https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
# this allows for 25 requests per day. so with 1 every 5 mins you will run out of api requests 2 hours after making a request.
# On further inspections they only allow 5 reqs per min 
# this did used to be 500reqs per day this would allow a req every 3 mins
